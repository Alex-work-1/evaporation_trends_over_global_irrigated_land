# Evapotranspiration trends over global irrigated land

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between changes in cropland and corresponding variations in evapotranspiration (ET) across global croplands. This analysis will be conducted using comprehensive global datasets for both ET and cropland.

By examining spatial and temporal patterns, the study aims to identify how changes in ET influence croplands. This will provide insights into the interactions between land use changes and the hydrological cycle, contributing to a better understanding of how agricultural expansion or reduction impacts global water balance and ecosystem services.
